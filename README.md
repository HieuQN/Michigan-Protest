# Michigan-Protest

##Abstract: Trust in the government is an important dimension of happiness according to the World Happiness
Report. Recently, however, social media platforms have been exploited to erode this trust by spreading
hate-filled, violent, anti-government sentiment. This trend was amplified during the Covid-19 pandemic to
protest the unpopular public health and safety measures imposed by governments to curb the spread
of the coronavirus. Detection and demotion of anti-government rhetoric, especially during turbulent
times such as the Covid-19 pandemic, can prevent an escalation of such sentiment into social unrest,
physical violence, and turmoil. This paper presents a classification framework to identify anti-government
sentiment on Twitter during politically motivated, anti-lockdown protests that occurred in the capital of
Michigan. From the tweets collected and annotated during the pair of protests, a rich set of features
was computed using both structured and unstructured data. Employing feature engineering grounded
in statistical analysis, importance measures, and principal components; subsets of these features were
selected to train popular machine learning classifiers. The classifiers can efficiently detect tweets which
promote an anti-government view with around 87% accuracy. These classifiers thus demonstrate the
feasibility of separating anti-government content from social media dialogue in a chaotic, emotionally
charged real-life situation.
